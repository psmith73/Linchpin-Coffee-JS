        "paraOne" : "Coffee is one of the most complex beverages on the planet, containing over 1,000 chemical compounds. Describing such a complex product presents a challenge, but doing so can be empowering: it can help a person or a company understand what they like, make more informed purchasing decisions, and identify and track product quality over time. In order to help guide these descriptions, many food and beverage industries have developed flavor wheels. A flavor wheel, simply put, is a circle of words. These words form a vocabulary to describe the sensory characteristics of a product. Since we rarely experience pure chemical compounds, the flavors are most often expressed as other foods and beverages.",
        "paraTwo" : "In 2013, Counter Culture released our Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel which represented the shared vocabulary that tasters at Counter Culture used when describing coffee flavor. Being a company passionate about education, we made the wheel available for free on our website. The wheel has become a popular tool utilized by beginner and expert coffee tasters world-wide. Countless coffee shops and cupping labs display the colorful wheel as both a tool and reminder of coffee’s diverse flavors.",
        "paraThree" : "We are excited to release a new version of the Coffee Taster’s Flavor Wheel—a slightly more modern design with some vocabulary tweaks to reflect what we’re currently tasting—along with a Spanish-translated edition. There is, of course, a vast range of words used to describe flavor across individuals, cultures, and dialects, but there are also many commonalities. There’s no one right answer, but there is excitement in being able to articulate an experience and joy when consensus is reached with others. Tools like the flavor wheel help us get there.",
